						<h2><a name="what" class="has-text-dark">What is Mythril?</a></h2>
					    <p>Mythril is a platform that allows users to track, discover, review and recommend video games. More features for the website are planned but at the moment because everything is being maintained by one person, it may take some time.</p>

					    <h2><a name="why" class="has-text-dark">Why did you make Mythril?</a></h2>
					    <p>In addition to having an interest in web development and video games, people in other gaming communities have expressed an interest in a website such as this.</p>

					    <h2><a name="how" class="has-text-dark">How are games consolidated?</a></h2>
					    <p>On some more prominent gaming websites, games generally have their own page/section even if it's the same game just on different platforms. In order to consolidate pages such as these, the following guidelines are used when adding games to the database.</p>

					    <p><em class="has-text-grey">Note: These guidelines are not set in stone and may change in the future. If you would like to provide some feedback regarding this process, please join our Discord server and let us know!</em></p>

					    <h2><a name="bugs" class="has-text-dark">I found a bug/factual error with the site, what should I do?</a></h2>
						<p>Currently there isn't a method to contact us through the website (this feature will be coming in the near future), so the best way would be to join our Discord server and inform us of any issues, bugs, factual errors or feature requests.</p>
					    
					    <h2><a name="support" class="has-text-dark">How can I support Mythril?</a></h2>
					    <p>Let us know what aspects of the site could be improved upon or what features you'd like to see. <!-- Join our Discord server, and tell other people about Mythril! --></p>
